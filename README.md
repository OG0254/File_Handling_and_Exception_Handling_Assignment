File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment
This repository contains a Python program designed to demonstrate file reading, writing, and comprehensive error handling as part of the File Read & Write Challenge and Error Handling Lab.
Project Overview
The program (file_handler.py) reads a text file provided by the user, modifies its content (converts it to uppercase as an example), and writes the modified content to a new file. It includes robust error handling for various scenarios, such as missing files or permission issues.
Files

file_handler.py: The main Python script that handles file reading, modification, and writing with error handling.
test.txt: A sample text file for testing the program.
modified_test.txt: The output file generated by the script, containing the modified (uppercase) content of the input file.

Features

Reads a user-specified text file.
Modifies the content by converting it to uppercase.
Writes the modified content to a new file with a modified_ prefix.
Handles errors including:
File not found
Permission issues
Invalid file types (e.g., directories)
Non-text file content
General I/O errors
User cancellation (Ctrl+C)



Requirements

Python 3.x

How to Run

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/OG0254/File_Handling_and_Exception_Handling_Assignment.git
cd File_Handling_and_Exception_Handling_Assignment


Ensure test.txt or another text file exists in the repository directory.
Run the script:python file_handler.py


Enter the name of the input file (e.g., test.txt) when prompted.
Check the output file (e.g., modified_test.txt) for the modified content.

Example
Input file (test.txt):
This is a test file.
It has multiple lines.
For testing file handling.

Run the program:
python file_handler.py
Enter the name of the file to read: test.txt
Successfully read test.txt and wrote modified content to modified_test.txt

Output file (modified_test.txt):
THIS IS A TEST FILE.
IT HAS MULTIPLE LINES.
FOR TESTING FILE HANDLING.

Error Handling
The program handles the following errors:

FileNotFoundError: When the specified file does not exist.
PermissionError: When there are insufficient permissions to read or write.
IsADirectoryError: When a directory is provided instead of a file.
UnicodeDecodeError: When the file contains non-text data or incorrect encoding.
IOError: For general input/output errors.
KeyboardInterrupt: When the user cancels the operation (Ctrl+C).
Other unexpected errors with appropriate messages.
